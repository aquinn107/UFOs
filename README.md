# UFOs

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the provided data around UFO sightings.

## Resources Used
- HTML: Created the webpage that will allow users to view the data.
- JavaScript: Used to create the dynamic table that presents the data in a user-friendly interface.

## Results
The original webpage was helpful by creating a simple filter for the data based on the date of the occurance, but we realized we could provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the original date filter created, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
While the dynamic table is able to help users sort through various data referencing presentations of UFO, there is a potential drawback for the data itself. If someone is not familiar with the available options in the data (i.e. "shapes") the user may not be able to effectively parse through all available data. Knowing this, I would recommend the following:
- Rather than have text entry, I would add a dropdown that would provide all available options for a user to select from. This would help give all users the ability to filter based on what data is present and help those that may not be as familiar with UFO occurance/instances.
- Another option, is if we were able to add a dynamic map feature. With this feature, we would be able to zoom in and place a marker on where the occurence occured. With this, if we were to include a "rough sketch" or an example of what the different shapes that have been seen look like for others to become more familiar to keep their eyes on the sky just in case they experience their own sighting.
